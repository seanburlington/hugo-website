by Bob

A rain drop as big as Earth,

the howl of a wolf and the sound of sizzling hot lava,

a razor sharp knife and a cloak of fire,

500 fossils of ice,

<!--more-->

a colossal thorny bush which spurts honey from itâ€™s spikes,

infinite honeysuckles to suck on,

the awesome smell of baking bacon,

a feather that changes colour from the fantastic rainbow bird,

a new pet rainbow snake and a delighted smile.

We went to Rainbow Jungle...

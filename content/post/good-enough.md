Steve Jobs famously said

> Good enough isn't good enough

Despite being famous I'm not sure he actually said this.

It's a popular idea but I consider it harmful.

Sometimes we should strive for excellence, but by no means always.

First of all it's important to say that "Good Enough" doesn't mean bad - it has to actually - be good enough.

Sometimes people use the phrase as shorthand for shoddy work - and that isn't what I mean.

If something is mission critical - it has to work.

But often it is more important to get something mostly working quickly - than to wait too long for perfection.

> Perfect is the enemy of good

Work has to be of an appropriate quality - we are not all mass producing mass-consumer articles sold at a high price - sometimes cost and time are more important than quality (and it's not like Apple products are perfect anyway)

So the key question in my mind is often

> Is this good enough ?

Often it isn't and I need to keep polishing.

Sometimes the answer is - yes it will do for now - I can use this version while I improve it.

But the answer depends both on the quality of the work at the time and on the present need.

The longer it takes to get a product to market - the longer the time when money is being spent and the shorter the time it is being earned.

Do good work - and make it earn a living.

Ship it !

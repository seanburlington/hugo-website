There is no conflict between lockdown and business.

Of course the lockdown is bad for business - but it's better than (more) mass death and the loss of confidence that would follow.

Unlocking early only means we can have no confidence in our trajectory - we may well see a rise in infections, NHS overwhelmed again, and we go back to square one.

Meanwhile businesses that bought stock and tried to start up again have to close and have burned more reserves.

Better to wait a bit till cases are lower, test & trace is operational - and we can manage outbreaks effectively.

Better to lockdown just once and follow a clear path out where people have a better idea what to expect.

Do it right - do it once.

My News years resolution 2021 is to watch less TV and read more books. Off to a good start with my Christmas reading.

This was a gift from my wife who heard me complain to many times about history books being all about Kings.

This book does include some stuff about royalty - but is a much wider overview of what life was actually like for people of a range of different classes (and class was very important to these people)

Since this is a short book aimed at a lay audience and covers 100 years of history it leaves many questions unanswered (that's good there are more books)

I enjoyed it and feel like I have a much better understanding of this time - and perhaps the time that can still be heard today. In fact the strongest impression I have is of just how superstitious and hierarchical a people can be and how "common sense" may not be a great guide to enlightenment.

I am really glad I don't live in those times, the food sounds awful (when there was any) the diseases awful - the doctors worse - and just when you think you're reached the bottom - the torture !!

The clothing is fascinating, the smell awful - but so much peace, music, dance and poetry.

You know - I think the author achieved his goal - I feel like I've been there and I'm glad to be back home.
